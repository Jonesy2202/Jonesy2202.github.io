                        Hi, I'm Ryan, and I am a graduate from Aberystwyth University. I studied Business Information
                        Technology
                        where I learned front-end and back-end web development.

                        In my time in education I found myself enjoying the more creative subjects such as graphic
                        design and art,
                        as well as D&T and IT. These subjects are what made me end up pursuing a career in web
                        development.

                            Java, Kotlin, Arduino C, and SQL. Other skills I have gained include photo and image editing

                            problem solving by learning how to solve problems in different ways in languages I have

                            and looked good. In high school, I picked the more creative subjects like Resistant
                            Materials, Art, and
                            Graphic design to allow me to design and create things.

                            promoting a
                            business through social media, and Fine Art, where I created a range of wire models of
